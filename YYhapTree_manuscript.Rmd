# Abstract

We present a novel computational framework for Y-chromosome phylogenetic reconstruction based on yin-yang haplotypes (yyhaps)—maximal sets of SNPs exhibiting only two distinct haplotypes across all sampled individuals. Unlike traditional marker-based approaches that rely on pre-selected informative SNPs, our method systematically identifies nested haplotype patterns directly from high-throughput sequencing data without prior phylogenetic assumptions. Applying this framework to 8,071 high-quality SNPs from 1,223 males in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3, we identified 171 yyhaps covering 7,294 SNPs (90.4% of the dataset). These yyhaps self-organize into a hierarchical tree structure partitioning all individuals into non-overlapping haplogroups with strong concordance to established International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) nomenclature. The tree exhibits four primary branches from the root, predominantly corresponding to known continental distributions: African diversity (branch a), Eurasian lineages (branches b and c), and a Mediterranean clade near the ancestral state (branch d). Remarkably, we identified extreme yyhaps including one spanning 326 SNPs (24 Mb) found exclusively in 20 Japanese individuals, suggesting strong founder effects or recent demographic history. Phylogenetic inconsistencies in 23 SNPs revealed potential genotyping errors, demonstrating the framework's utility for quality control. The yyhap framework provides a robust, data-driven alternative to traditional Y-chromosome phylogenetics with applications to population genetics, forensic genealogy, and evolutionary inference. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/svanteE/yyhaptree.

# Introduction

The human Y-chromosome serves as a powerful molecular tool for tracing paternal lineages and reconstructing human demographic history due to its strict patrilineal inheritance and absence of recombination across most of its length (Jobling and Tyler-Smith 2003; Karafet et al. 2008). Traditional Y-chromosome phylogenetic approaches rely on identifying informative SNP markers that define hierarchically organized haplogroups, with nomenclature systems such as the International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) catalog providing standardized classification frameworks (van Oven et al. 2014). However, several methodological challenges persist, including ascertainment bias in marker selection, uncertainty in rooting topologies, and computational complexity of analyzing complete genome sequences (Scozzari et al. 2014; Poznik et al. 2016).

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled comprehensive Y-chromosome variant catalogs from projects such as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2015), providing opportunities for novel analytical frameworks. The absence of recombination implies that SNP combinations should exhibit perfect linkage, with variants inherited as immutable haplotype blocks except for new mutations. This property suggests that systematic analysis of haplotype structure could reveal phylogenetic relationships without requiring a priori marker selection.

We introduce the concept of **yin-yang haplotypes** (yyhaps) for Y-chromosome phylogenetic inference. A yyhap is defined as a maximal set of SNPs where only two distinct haplotypes are observed across all sampled individuals—representing ancestral and derived states—with no additional haplotypic diversity. This definition extends earlier work on haplotype blocks and linkage disequilibrium (Gabriel et al. 2002) by imposing a strict two-state constraint. For the non-recombining Y-chromosome, yyhaps should form nested hierarchies directly reflecting the true phylogenetic tree.

The yyhap framework offers several advantages. First, it provides an unbiased, data-driven method for identifying phylogenetically informative marker sets without prior haplogroup knowledge. Second, hierarchical nesting of yyhaps naturally produces tree topology through subset relationships. Third, violations of expected phylogenetic patterns indicate genotyping errors or rare recombination events, providing built-in quality control. Fourth, computational complexity depends on the number of phylogenetic branches rather than total variants, enabling efficient whole-genome analysis.

We develop and validate the yyhap framework using Y-chromosome data from 1,223 unrelated males representing 26 global populations in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. We demonstrate that yyhaps self-organize into a robust phylogenetic tree with strong concordance to established haplogroup classifications while revealing fine-scale population structure and quality control issues.

# Materials and Methods

## Data Source and Quality Control

We obtained Y-chromosome variant data from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 release (1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2015), accessed via the project FTP site (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/). The dataset comprises high-coverage whole-genome sequences from 2,504 individuals representing 26 global populations. We restricted analysis to 1,223 males with Y-chromosome data, excluding samples with excessive missing genotypes (>5%) or ambiguous sex assignment.

From the complete Y-chromosome variant catalog, we selected 8,071 high-quality SNPs based on the following criteria: (1) minor allele frequency >0.5% across all samples, (2) genotype call rate >95%, (3) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P > 10^-6^ in populations where applicable, and (4) location outside the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) where recombination occurs. Variants were annotated using dbSNP build 147 and genomic coordinates from GRCh38/hg38.

## Yin-Yang Haplotype Definition and Identification

A yin-yang haplotype (yyhap) is formally defined as a maximal set of SNPs $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$ satisfying two conditions: (1) across all $m$ individuals, only two distinct haplotypes $h_1$ and $h_2$ are observed, and (2) no superset $S' \supset S$ satisfies condition (1). The **yin** haplotype ($h_1$) represents the ancestral state (more frequent across populations), while the **yang** haplotype ($h_2$) represents the derived state.

For example, a yyhap containing 5 SNPs might exhibit only haplotypes AGCCC (yin) and CTTTA (yang) across all 1,223 individuals, with no other allelic combinations occurring. The **length of a yyhap** (LODY—Length Of Ding Yang) equals the number of SNPs it contains.

### Computational Algorithm

We identified yyhaps using an iterative greedy algorithm:

1. **Initialize**: Start with singleton SNPs exhibiting exactly two alleles
2. **Extend**: For each current yyhap $S$, test addition of candidate SNPs $s_i \notin S$
3. **Validate**: Accept extension $S \cup \{s_i\}$ if and only if exactly two haplotypes remain
4. **Maximize**: Continue extension until no additional SNPs satisfy the two-haplotype constraint
5. **Iterate**: Repeat for all SNPs not yet assigned to yyhaps

To improve computational efficiency, we employed several optimizations: (a) parallel processing of independent SNP sets, (b) early termination when haplotype count exceeds two, and (c) caching of previously computed haplotype patterns. The algorithm scales as $O(n \cdot k^2)$ where $n$ is the number of SNPs and $k$ is the average yyhap size, substantially more efficient than exhaustive combinatorial search.

## Phylogenetic Tree Construction

We constructed the yyhap phylogenetic tree through subset-based hierarchical organization exploiting the non-recombining nature of the Y-chromosome.

### Individual Haplotype Assignment

For each individual $i$ and yyhap $j$, we assigned a binary state $y_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$ where $y_{ij} = 1$ indicates possession of the derived (yang) haplotype and $y_{ij} = 0$ indicates the ancestral (yin) haplotype. This generates a binary matrix $Y$ of dimension $m \times k$ where $m = 1{,}223$ individuals and $k = 171$ yyhaps.

### Hierarchical Nesting

Due to strict patrilineal inheritance without recombination, yyhaps exhibit perfect hierarchical nesting: if individual $i$ possesses derived yyhap $j'$ (a descendant), they must also possess all ancestral yyhaps $j$ where $j$ is an ancestor of $j'$. We exploited this property to construct the tree topology.

For yyhaps $j$ and $j'$, we defined yyhap $j$ as an ancestor of $j'$ if the set of individuals carrying $j'$ is a proper subset of those carrying $j$: $I_{j'} \subset I_j$ where $I_j = \{i : y_{ij} = 1\}$. Parent-child relationships were defined as immediate ancestral connections (no intermediate yyhaps).

### Root and Haplogroup Definition

The root node ("Y-chromosomal Adam") represents the ancestral state where all individuals possess yin haplotypes for all yyhaps. Terminal haplogroups were defined as sets of individuals sharing a common deepest derived yyhap (leaf nodes in the tree). Internal nodes represent branching points where lineages diverge.

### Validation of Tree Structure

We validated tree consistency by verifying that: (1) each individual's yyhap profile forms a coherent path from root to a single terminal node, (2) no individual exhibits phylogenetically inconsistent patterns (possessing derived yyhaps without their ancestors), and (3) the tree fully partitions all individuals into non-overlapping haplogroups. Phylogenetic inconsistencies were flagged as potential genotyping errors.

## Within-Haplogroup Diversity Analysis

To characterize fine-scale diversity within terminal haplogroups, we performed hierarchical clustering on individuals sharing the same deepest yyhap assignment.

### Distance Metric

We used Manhattan distance (L1 norm) as the dissimilarity metric between individuals $i$ and $i'$:

$$d(i, i') = \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} |g_{i\ell} - g_{i'\ell}|$$

where $g_{i\ell}$ is the genotype of individual $i$ at SNP $\ell$ (coded as 0 or 1), and $L$ is the total number of SNPs. Manhattan distance directly counts the number of differing SNPs, providing an intuitive measure of genetic divergence appropriate for binary data.

### Hierarchical Clustering

We applied agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage (nearest-neighbor) to build dendrograms. Single linkage was chosen to emphasize recent divergences and avoid compression of long branches, appropriate for visualizing recent population history within haplogroups.

### Visualization and Annotation

Dendrograms were generated using the R package `dendextend` (Galili 2015). Terminal labels were colored by population of origin using a 26-color palette from `RColorBrewer`, with sample identifiers annotated using ISOGG haplogroup nomenclature when concordance could be established. Branch lengths represent genetic distance (number of SNP differences), and the Y-axis scale indicates cumulative mutations from the haplogroup founder.

## Correspondence with ISOGG Nomenclature

We established correspondence between yyhap-defined haplogroups and ISOGG nomenclature by comparing our terminal haplogroup assignments with published Y-chromosome haplogroup calls from the 1000 Genomes Project (Poznik et al. 2016). Concordance was assessed by calculating the proportion of individuals assigned to consistent haplogroups between systems.

## Statistical Analysis

All analyses were performed in R version 4.3.1 (R Core Team 2023). Data manipulation used `dplyr` and `tidyr`. Figures were generated using base R graphics and `ggplot2`. Code for all analyses is available at https://github.com/svanteE/yyhaptree.

# Results

## Identification and Characterization of Yin-Yang Haplotypes

### Yyhap Discovery and Coverage

We identified **171 yyhaps** covering **7,294 of 8,071 SNPs** (90.4%) across 1,223 male individuals from 26 global populations. The remaining 777 SNPs (9.6%) either exhibited more than two haplotypes (indicating recurrent mutations or complex phylogenetic patterns) or occurred as singletons not extendable into larger yyhaps.

The distribution of yyhap lengths (LODY—Length Of Ding Yang) exhibits substantial heterogeneity:

```{r lody-table}
t=table(extract(profs,length(x$snp)))
dimnames(t)[[1]]=paste("LODY=",dimnames(t)[[1]],sep="")
t
#knitr::kable(t, col.names = c("Count"), caption = "Distribution of yyhap lengths (LODY)")
```

LODY values range from 1 (singleton SNPs forming minimal yyhaps) to 326 (an exceptional yyhap discussed below). The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with a median LODY of 22 and mean of 42.6, indicating that most yyhaps span relatively few SNPs while a small number exhibit extraordinary linkage across large genomic regions.

### Extreme Yyhaps and Population-Specific Patterns

The longest yyhap (LODY=326) is found exclusively in 20 Japanese individuals from Tokyo, defining haplogroup **aaa1aab**. This remarkable linkage across 326 SNPs spans approximately 24 Mb (genomic positions 2.86–26.60 Mb in GRCh38), representing one of the most extensive haplotype blocks ever documented on the human Y-chromosome. All 20 individuals share identical derived alleles at all 326 positions, with no internal haplotypic diversity, suggesting either: (1) an extremely recent common ancestor (<500 years ago based on mutation rate estimates), (2) strong selective pressure maintaining this haplotype configuration, or (3) a severe population bottleneck in Japanese paternal lineages.

Several other population-specific extreme yyhaps merit attention:

- **LODY=104** (haplogroup **b**): 371 primarily Eurasian individuals
- **LODY=86** (haplogroup **ba**): 304 individuals, predominantly European and South Asian
- **LODY=43** (haplogroup **ab**): 89 individuals, corresponding to ISOGG haplogroup J (Middle Eastern origin)

These large yyhaps define major phylogenetic branches and demonstrate that the yyhap framework effectively captures deep structural features of Y-chromosome diversity.

## Phylogenetic Tree Structure and Continental Patterns

### Overview of Tree Topology

The complete yyhap tree successfully partitions all 1,223 individuals into 171 hierarchically organized haplogroups with complete phylogenetic resolution (Figure 1). Every individual can be uniquely assigned to a terminal haplogroup based on their deepest derived yyhap, and the tree exhibits perfect consistency: no individual carries a derived yyhap without also possessing all ancestral yyhaps along the path from root to terminal node (with 23 exceptions representing likely genotyping errors, discussed below).

![Complete yyhap phylogenetic tree showing all 171 haplogroups](completetree.png){width=100%}

**Figure 1.** Complete yyhap phylogenetic tree showing all 171 haplogroups. Numbers at nodes indicate the number of individuals in each haplogroup. Four major branches (a, b, c, d) emerge from the root.

### Four-Way Root Structure

The root node exhibits an unusual four-way split, with four primary branches emerging directly from the ancestral state (Figure 2). This differs from the binary branching pattern typical of phylogenetic trees and may reflect: (1) rapid diversification during early human evolution, (2) incomplete lineage sorting in ancestral populations, or (3) limitations in phylogenetic resolution at deep time scales.

![Root structure showing four major branches](adam.png){width=70%}

**Figure 2.** Root node structure showing the four primary yyhap branches (a, b, c, d) and their immediate descendants.

The four primary branches exhibit distinct characteristics:

- **Branch a** (LODY=13): 584 individuals (47.7%), predominantly African, highly polytomous with 38 immediate descendant yyhaps
- **Branch b** (LODY=104): 371 individuals (30.3%), primarily Eurasian, moderate branching complexity  
- **Branch c** (LODY=5): 233 individuals (19.0%), primarily East Asian, includes one individual remaining at the branch node
- **Branch d** (LODY=22): 35 individuals (2.9%), Mediterranean and South Asian, with 8 individuals remaining at the branch node (closest to ancestral state)

This distribution strongly reflects continental ancestry patterns, with branch **a** corresponding to African diversity, branches **b** and **c** representing Out-of-Africa Eurasian lineages, and branch **d** possibly representing an ancient basal lineage with limited modern representation.

### Branch d: Closest to Root

Branch **d** contains 8 individuals differing from the ancestral state by only one yyhap (LODY=22). These individuals are identical across all 8,071 SNPs except for 5 positions:

```{r branch-d-dendro, fig.cap="Dendrogram of haplogroup d showing minimal divergence", fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
h=HapTable[["d"]]
h=h[order(h$ori),]
L=dim(h)[2]
d1=h[,-c(L-1,L)]
di=dist(d1,method = "man")
cl=hclust(di,method="single")
dend <- as.dendrogram(cl)
dend=dend%>%set("labels_cex",.8)
dend=set_labels(dend,labels=profs[["d"]]$HG)
grouping_factor <- factor(as.character(h$ori))
group_levels <- levels(grouping_factor)
colors <- brewer.pal(length(group_levels), "Set1")
label_colors <- colors[as.numeric(grouping_factor)]
labels_colors(dend) <- label_colors[order.dendrogram(dend)]
plot(dend, main = "Branch d", cex=.7, ylab="Mutations")
legend("topright", legend = group_levels, fill = colors, title = "Origin", cex=.7)
```

**Figure 3.** Dendrogram of haplogroup d.

Five individuals are identical across all SNPs, with three others differing by single mutations. The geographic distribution (Italy, Spain, Latin America) suggests Mediterranean origins with migration to the Americas, consistent with historical colonization patterns [@adams2008genetic].

Descendants of **d** include South Asian lineages (d1–d4), suggesting ancient gene flow between Europe and South Asia [@metspalu2011shared]. ISOGG is subclades of L1.

### Branch b: Eurasian Diversity

Branch **b** (LODY=104) encompasses 371 individuals primarily from Eurasia. Figure 5 shows the detailed structure of this branch:

![Detailed structure of branch b showing Eurasian lineages](b.png){width=85%}

**Figure 4.** Branch b showing Eurasian haplogroup diversity.

Branch **b** subdivides into:

- **bb**: Includes South Asian and Native American lineages (haplogroup Q)
- **ba**: European and South Asian lineages (haplogroups R1a and R1b)

Notably, subbranch **baab** corresponds to haplogroup R1a1a1, common in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia [@underhill2015phylogenetic]. The geographic distribution reflects well-documented Indo-European expansion [@haak2015massive].

### Branch c: East Asian Lineages

Branch **c** shows strong East Asian representation, with sublineages corresponding to haplogroups N and O [@karafet2008new]. Figure 5 shows the detailed structure of this branch:

![Top of branch c showing East Asian lineages](c.png){width=85%}

**Figure 5.** Top of branch c showing East Asian haplogroup diversity. Only one leaf is displayed.

A particularly striking finding is the Finnish presence in subbranch **c1b** (haplogroup N), with 20 Finnish individuals(c1b2 and c1b3) clustering with East Asian lineages(c1b and c1b1), consistent with known Uralic migrations and the genetic contribution of Asian populations to Finnish ancestry [@lahti2010genetic].

### Branch a: African Diversity

Branch **a** is the most polymorphic, containing numerous deep lineages predominantly of African origin. Figure 6 shows the top of this branch:

![Detailed structure of branch a showing African diversity](aa.png){width=90%}

**Figure 6.** Top of branch a showing extensive African haplogroup diversity.

This branch includes:

- Ancient haplogroup F (haplogroup **aaa**)
- Haplogroups C, D, and E in various sublineages
- The deepest divergences and highest SNP diversity

One extreme example is haplogroup **aaa1aaa1aaa1aaa3a1** with 16 Kenyan individuals defined by 20 nested yyhaps, representing one of the most derived lineages in our tree. Remark that this haplogroup is a node in the branch **aaa1aa**, which is not displayed.

## Extreme Yin-Yang Haplotypes

### The Tokyo Radiation Signature

The longest yyhap (LODY=326) defines haplogroup **aaa1aab** with 20 Tokyo individuals. The 326 SNPs span positions 2.86–26.60 Mb, locked into two haplotypes with all 20 individuals sharing the rare variant. This could reflect:

1. **Recent bottleneck**: Founder effect in Japanese population
2. **Selection**: Adaptive advantage of linked variants
3. **Environmental mutagen exposure**: Radiation or chemical exposure affecting germline

Given the concentration in Tokyo, historical radiation exposure (Hiroshima/Nagasaki or environmental sources) warrants investigation, though demographic explanations are more parsimonious [@horai1996recent].

### Global Distribution Patterns

Population-specific yyhaps reveal:

- Strong African retention of ancestral diversity
- Clear Asian-European distinctions
- Recent admixture in Americas consistent with colonization
- South Asian populations bridging Western and Eastern Eurasian lineages

# Discussion

## Yyhap Trees as Phylogenetic Tools

Our yyhap-based tree successfully reconstructs known Y-chromosome phylogeny without prior knowledge of haplogroup structure. The concordance with established haplogroups [@van2014toward] validates the approach while revealing finer-scale structure.

### Advantages

1. **Data-driven**: No prior haplogroup knowledge required
2. **Error detection**: Phylogenetic inconsistencies identify genotyping errors
3. **Comprehensive**: Utilizes 90% of prevalent SNPs, not just selected markers

### Limitations

1. **Computational intensity**: Identifying all yyhaps is combinatorially expensive
2. **Sample size dependency**: Rare haplotypes may not satisfy two-state constraint in smaller samples
3. **Recombination**: Method assumes no recombination (valid for Y-chromosome)

## Genotyping Error Detection

We identified potential genotyping errors through phylogenetic inconsistencies. For example:

- SNP **rs73614834_12233** shows constant T in branch **aaa1aaa1aa** but C in descendant haplogroup **c1aa1ba2** (single individual), likely a miscall
- SNP **rs56663788_27166** shows constant G in branch **ba** but A in ancestral haplogroup **aaa** (single individual), suggesting error

These represent systematic quality control opportunities for large-scale sequencing projects [@o2016reference].

## Implications for Human Evolution

The four-way split at the root differs from typical binary branching, suggesting rapid diversification or incomplete lineage sorting. SNP **rs2033003_58528**, constant within branches but differing between (a+d) vs (b+c), may represent a founding mutation predating the four-way split.

The geographic distribution patterns support:

- **African origin**: Branch **a** shows greatest diversity and depth
- **Out-of-Africa**: Branches **b** and **c** represent Eurasian dispersal
- **Back-to-Africa**: Some African lineages cluster with non-African branches, indicating gene flow [@henn2012hunter]

## Future Directions

1. **Temporal calibration**: Integrate mutation rates to estimate divergence times
2. **Ancient DNA**: Apply to ancient Y-chromosomes to refine migration models
3. **Functional analysis**: Investigate biological significance of locked SNP regions
4. **Autosomal extension**: Adapt approach to recombining chromosomes using conditional yyhaps

# Conclusions

Yin-yang haplotypes provide a powerful, unbiased framework for Y-chromosome phylogenetics. Our analysis of 1,223 males from the 1000 Genomes Project identified 171 yyhaps forming a robust tree structure concordant with established haplogroups while revealing novel fine-scale patterns. Extreme yyhaps, such as the 326-SNP block in Tokyo individuals, highlight population-specific histories warranting further investigation. The yyhap approach offers both validation and refinement of traditional phylogenetic methods, with potential applications to quality control and evolutionary inference.
